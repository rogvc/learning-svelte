# Sophisticated Hello World

This is a *(not so)* simple page presented as a more sophisticated and in-depth look at Svelte. In it, you will find a pretty good overview of what a Svelte file looks like, and why this framework is awesome. 

You can easily check the results out for yourself by copying the files in this directory into [Svelte's REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/).
